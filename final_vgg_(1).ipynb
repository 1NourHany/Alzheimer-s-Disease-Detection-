This notebook will feature a vgg16 model, trained in fastAI, and using progressive resizing and cutout to attain better results. Updated for september, I added some additional visuals to help understand the training and added a new section at the end for practical applications in healthcare.\n",

Weight decay worked just fine at 1e-1, did some experimenting but the accuracy never got much higher than 80% with other weight decay settings. As a funny side note I tested this with multiple different models, and the learning rate curves optimal point stayed the same, but the steepness of the slope was different (the larger models had a flatter curve while the smaller models had a sharper one).

The one nitpick about the model I have is that it will generate a small number of false negatives (the model would predict someone does not have alzheimers when they do).\n",

        "In training and validation the model is able to get an accuracy score as high as 99% and an F_beta of around .98, however on test data the model is only able to achieve 95%. The final piece in getting this model's performance up is to focus on how to tone the overfitting down a smidge (In my personal experience, the best performing models are always slightly overfit). There is probably room for improvement with the transforms that I chose for the images. There may also be room for improvement by adding another resizing step or changing some of the dimensions in the current step. It's also possible that combining the results from this model with another would be necessary to close the gap for 98%.\n",
